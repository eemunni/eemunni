## Hello uwu 👋

I'm eemunni and you probs found this profile from my discord kek

I write shitty code when I'm bored or motivated to do shit. I mainly use Node.Js, but I'm learning Java too (mainly for JDA and Minecraft plugins/mods). Few of my projects/repos are private because I don't like to show my bad coding to everyone. I might in future make my repos public who knows :shrug: Currently I'm developing my shitty discord bots (UwU bot & (~˘▾˘)━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ (a music bot)) and both are private ofc.

I watch anime and read manga because I'm no social life owning weeb.
