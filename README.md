## Hello there 👋

I'm eemunni and you probs found this profile from my discord :3

I write shitty code when I'm bored or motivated to do shit. I mainly use Node.Js, but I'm learning Java too (mainly for School work :bruh:). Few of my projects/repos are private because I don't like to show my bad coding to everyone.

I watch anime and read manga because I'm no social life owning weeb.
